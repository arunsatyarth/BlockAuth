# Why we need a decentralized authentication solution
1. There are a lot of Centralized authentication solution  based on the OpenID protocol like facebook, google etc. You would have seen the nice "Login with facebook" icon a lot. In exchange for the user experience, you do give up your privacy. You would have noticed the things that you browsed on a shopping site show up in facebook a lot. facebook sometimes uses things called tracking pixels using which all users data is shared between the sites.

2. The web as a whole is moving to decentralization. We have decentralized payment, social network, chat apps etc. In that case they cannot use just one part as decentralized and the other centralized. So we are in need of a decentralixed authentication solution as well. 

# What BlockAuth does
Blockauth has a few smart contracts using which you permanently put your user details in the blockchain instead of a 3rd party app like facebook. You can then visit any website which supports BlockAuth login and sign in using your data in the blockchain.
